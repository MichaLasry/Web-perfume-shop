Online Shop - perfume

This is an online shop for perfumery that I wrote in Js using the MERN Stack method.

This method includes server-side and client-side development.

The front-end development with **React** (_which includes redux and react hooks_) and the backend with **Node-js**.

I used the server with the **express** package and the routing too.

The DB that I used is **MongoDB** through mongoose.

All the packages that are used from **npm**.
