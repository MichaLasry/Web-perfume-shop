Online Shop - perfume

This is an online shop for perfumery that I wrote in Js using the MERN Stack method.

This method includes server-side and client-side development.

The development in the frontend with React and the backend with Node-js.

I used the server with the express package and the routing too.

all the packages that are used from npm
